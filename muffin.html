    <h1>Muffins, the early years</h1>
    <Hr>
    <p>Hi. My name is Muffins. I am a mighty
    cat. I was adopted by my family when I was
    only three weeks old.</p>
    <p>My new mommy is a human. They are funny
    creatures. </p>
    <p>I left the pound with my new mommy and
    new sister, Maria. They took me straight to
    the pet store to buy:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>A kitty baby bottle and formula</li>
    <li>A small cloth toy</li>
    <li>Litter box with litter</li>
    <li>Food (for later)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mom and sis had to feed me by bottle
    because I was so young.</p>
